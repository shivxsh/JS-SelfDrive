1) Build the road like initial structure by using the canvas in html and aligning it to the center with width 200

2) Create a new "Car"  class in car.js (steps explained in that file.)
   Call that car object from main.js
   ctx stores the context of the canvas, which will be the parameter taken by the "draw()" method

3) Movement of the car : 
    create a controls.js file.
    make a new class called controls with a constructor

4) Inside the controls file, we used a private method called keyboard listener.
   Inside this method, we used "onkeydown" and "onkeyup" methods to check if the key is pressed or is it released.
   While it is pressed, we set the respective key values declared inside of the constructor as true. (By default we declared it as false)

5) The Y-axis  increases as it goes down on a computer.
   Hence, to show these changes on the screen, we move the canvas y-2 times for the card to move forward and
   y+2 times for it to move down.
   //This is the initial plan. Before implementing the speed and acceleration and stopping mechanisms.

6) To make this work, we use an "animate()" function in main.js
   It basically uses the "requestAnimationFrame()" method that repeatedly calls the animate method.
   This method calls the update() method and draw(context) method.

7) Now, we need to make the car move with a certain speed and acceleration. Also introduce friction to stop the car.
   Instead of doing Y-2 and Y+2 in step-5; We can now add acceleration with speed and subtract it for moving forward and backward.

    For the left and right movement, we need to "rotate" the car. For that, we introduce a variable called "angle"
    For every left and right key press, we use the translate() method to rotate the car 0.03 degrees anticlockwise.
